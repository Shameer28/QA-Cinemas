# QA-Cinemas - Group 2's Week 11/12 Project

This is the github for the Group 2's Project. For week 11/12 we were tasked with making a MERN Stack Cinema Website. Mern uses MongoDB, Express, React, and Node. All 3 are made for developing with javascript and the front-end used html and css for the web-pages.
We used the agile methodology to plan our project. The whole project was split into two sprints.
